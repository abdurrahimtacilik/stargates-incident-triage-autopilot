# StarGates – Incident Triage Autopilot  
**Agentic AI for Enterprise Incident Response (IBM watsonx Orchestrate)**

StarGates is an **agentic AI incident-triage proof-of-concept** built with **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**.  
It transforms unstructured production alerts into **prioritized actions, validated hypotheses, and ITSM-ready incident tickets** by orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents.

Unlike traditional chatbots, StarGates separates **decision-making, evidence collection, and root-cause analysis** into independent agents coordinated through an explicit orchestration workflow.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Enterprise operations teams spend significant time manually triaging incidents:

- Interpreting unstructured alerts  
- Searching runbooks  
- Collecting logs and metrics  
- Creating and updating incident tickets  

This manual process slows response time, increases operational load, and leads to inconsistent decisions.

StarGates automates this workflow using a **multi-agent architecture orchestrated by IBM watsonx Orchestrate**.

Given a single alert, the system:

1. Determines severity and business impact  
2. Selects the most relevant operational runbook  
3. Collects supporting evidence (logs, metrics, signals)  
4. Generates plausible root-cause hypotheses with validation steps  
5. Produces a prioritized action checklist and a draft incident ticket  

This demonstrates how **agentic AI** can be applied to real enterprise workflows beyond conversational assistants.

## 🧠 Agentic Architecture

StarGates uses a **clear separation of responsibilities** across multiple agents:

### 🔹 Sentinel Agent (Orchestrator)
- Analyzes incoming alerts  
- Selects the correct runbook from the knowledge base  
- Delegates tasks to other agents via watsonx Orchestrate  
- Synthesizes all outputs into a final action plan and ticket draft  

### 🔹 Evidence Collector Agent
- Gathers logs, metrics, and operational signals  
- Summarizes evidence without inventing data  
- Explicitly reports gaps when evidence is unavailable  

### 🔹 RCA Agent
- Generates **2–3 plausible root-cause hypotheses**  
- Explains supporting indicators and assumptions  
- Proposes concrete validation steps  
- Uses **qualitative confidence levels** (Low / Medium / Medium-High / High)  

**IBM watsonx Orchestrate** serves as the orchestration core, controlling agent delegation, execution order, and knowledge access.

## 🗺️ Architecture Overview

Flow:

1. An unstructured alert enters the system.  
2. The Sentinel Agent evaluates impact and selects a runbook.  
3. Evidence collection is delegated to the Evidence Collector Agent.  
4. Root-cause hypotheses are generated by the RCA Agent.  
5. The Sentinel compiles prioritized actions and an ITSM-ready incident ticket.

This design enables **selective delegation**:  
simple incidents resolve quickly, while complex incidents trigger deeper analysis.

## 🧪 Example Workflow: Payment Service Latency

**Input alert:**
> High latency detected in payment-service API.  
> Latency > 2.5s for 10 minutes. Checkout failures increasing.

**System behavior:**
- Runbook selection: *Payment Service Latency*  
- Evidence summarized by Evidence Collector  
- Competing hypotheses generated by RCA  
- Final output includes:
  - Prioritized actions with validation steps  
  - Mitigation options  
  - Draft incident ticket for ITSM systems  

**Result:** Faster triage, explainable decisions, and reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR).

## 📊 Observability & Runtime Metrics

StarGates exposes runtime metrics through IBM watsonx Orchestrate agent analytics.

During end-to-end incident workflows:
- Multiple specialized agents are invoked in a controlled sequence
- Agent-to-agent communication completes with zero failed messages
- Latency reflects intentional multi-agent reasoning and orchestration

Sample metrics observed during testing:
- Agents: 4 (Sentinel, Evidence Collector, RCA, system agent)
- Failed messages: 0
- Average end-to-end latency: ~5–6 seconds

This trade-off prioritizes correctness, explainability, and safe delegation over raw speed, which is appropriate for enterprise incident response workflows.
