# StarGates – Incident Triage Autopilot

StarGates is an agentic AI proof-of-concept built with IBM watsonx Orchestrate that automatically transforms unstructured incident alerts into structured, actionable operational outputs.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview (EN)

Enterprise operations teams spend significant time manually triaging incidents:
- Interpreting unstructured alerts
- Searching runbooks
- Collecting logs and metrics
- Creating incident tickets

StarGates automates this workflow using a multi-agent architecture orchestrated by IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

Given a single alert, the system:
1. Determines severity and business impact  
2. Selects the most relevant runbook  
3. Collects supporting evidence via tools  
4. Generates root-cause hypotheses  
5. Produces an action checklist and ticket draft  

This project demonstrates how agentic AI can be applied to real enterprise workflows beyond traditional chatbots.

## 🚀 Proje Özeti (TR)

StarGates, IBM watsonx Orchestrate kullanılarak geliştirilen agentic AI tabanlı bir proof-of-concept projedir. Amaç, yapılandırılmamış incident alarmlarını otomatik olarak aksiyona dönüştürülebilir çıktılara çevirmektir.

Tek bir alarm girdisi ile sistem:
1. Ciddiyet ve etkiyi belirler  
2. Uygun runbook’u seçer  
3. Tool’lar aracılığıyla kanıt toplar  
4. Kök neden hipotezleri üretir  
5. Aksiyon listesi ve ticket taslağı oluşturur

## 🧠 Architecture

StarGates uses a multi-agent architecture:
- **Sentinel Agent** – Alert analysis and orchestration
- **Evidence Collector Agent** – Log and metric collection
- **RCA Agent** – Root-cause hypothesis generation

IBM watsonx Orchestrate serves as the orchestration core.
