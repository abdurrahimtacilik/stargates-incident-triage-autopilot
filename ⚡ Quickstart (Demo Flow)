## ⚡ Quickstart (Demo Flow)

This repository demonstrates an agentic incident triage workflow using IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

**Demo flow:**
1. Review a sample incident alert in `knowledge/incidents/sample_incident_alerts.json`
2. Observe how the Sentinel Agent interprets severity and impact
3. Follow evidence collection via the Evidence Collector Agent using mocked tools
4. Review root-cause hypotheses generated by the RCA Agent
5. Examine the final structured outputs (action checklist and ticket draft)

The demo is designed around a single end-to-end incident scenario to clearly illustrate agent orchestration, tool usage, and decision flow.
